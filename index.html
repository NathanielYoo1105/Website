    Update 1:

    <br><br>
    Today we had a full class activity outside in the quad.
    The class was split into two teams and using half pipes, we had to get a marble into a bucket at the end.
    Each person had to hold the pipe at least once, we only had a couple so we had to pass them down to make sure everyone contributes.
    Of course our team won because we are simply better.
    I also finished the front page of this website (the fake 404) and successfully got everything else working.
