    Today we had a full class activity outside in the quad.
    The class was split into two teams and using half pipes, we had to get a marble into a bucket at the end.
    Each person had to hold the pipe at least once, we only had a couple so we had to pass them down to make sure everyone contributes.
    Of course our team won because we are simply better.
    I also finished the front page of this website (the fake 404) and successfully got everything else working.

    This is the first journal entry in a while. 
    Since the last journal entry, we had 2 quizzes, one on the 1st and one today.
    We've used TinkerCad to create our Rube Goldberg Machine CAD and started building the real thing.
    We also had a competition on who could build the best home appliance using TinkerCad.

    Last week we finished our physical Rube Goldberg Machine made out of cardboard and tape.
    We had quite a bit of trouble with our pulley and had to adjust the end of our machine to make it work.
    In the end, we used around 15 marbles to power the pulley, 16 if you include the big marble that pushed our lever.
    Our big marble was up against a wall and would move when the pulley hit the platform, but it didn't really work until I made a wedge out of scrap cardboard and tape.

    This past week we started our computer engineering lesson. 
    We learned about what computer engineers do and how it works. 
    We also dissected a desktop computer on Wednesday.

    This week we learned about bioengineering and its applications in real life.
    On Wednesday we made a prosthetic hand with carboard, rubber bands, and string.
    I did most of the work and Brandon mastered using it to pick up water bottles.
