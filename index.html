    Today we had a full class activity outside in the quad.<br>
    The class was split into two teams and using half pipes, we had to get a marble into a bucket at the end.<br>
    Each person had to hold the pipe at least once, we only had a couple so we had to pass them down to make sure everyone contributes.<br>
    Of course our team won because we are simply better.<br>
    I also finished the front page of this website (the fake 404) and successfully got everything else working.

    This is the first journal entry in a while. 
    Since the last journal entry, we had 2 quizzes, one on the 1st and one today.<br>
    We've used TinkerCad to create our Rube Goldberg Machine CAD and started building the real thing.<br>
    We also had a competition on who could build the best home appliance using TinkerCad.

    Last week we finished our physical Rube Goldberg Machine made out of cardboard and tape.<br>
    We had quite a bit of trouble with our pulley and had to adjust the end of our machine to make it work.<br>
    In the end, we used around 15 marbles to power the pulley, 16 if you include the big marble that pushed our lever.<br>
    Our big marble was up against a wall and would move when the pulley hit the platform, but it didn't really work until I made a wedge out of scrap cardboard and tape.

    This past week we started our computer engineering lesson.<br> 
    We learned about what computer engineers do and how it works.<br> 
    We also dissected a desktop computer on Wednesday.<br>
    We took everything apart and put it back together but we were missing a cpu and RAM so it didn't turn on.

    This week we learned about bioengineering and its applications in real life.<br>
    On Wednesday we made a prosthetic hand with carboard, rubber bands, and string.<br>
    We used rubber bands to hold the strings in place and act as joints for the fingers.<br>
    I did most of the work and Brandon mastered using it to pick up water bottles.

    Last week we started our aerospace engineering unit.<br>
    Aerospace engineering is a branch of engineering that studies aircraft and spacecraft.<br>
    Last week on Friday, we made a CAD of a bottle rocket.<br>
    On Monday I bought a 2 liter bottle of Coke and brought on Wednesday so we could make our actual rocket.<br>
    Today, we launched them on the uppper field using water and compressed air.<br>
    We got 2 attempts, our first one went pretty high and did a couple flips in the air.<br>
    Our second one went straight into the ground and went backwards.<br>
    We managed to spray Mr. Kim's ankles and get his socks wet though.<br>

    This week we began our environmental Environmental Engineering unit.<br>
    Environmental Engineering is a field of engineering that integrates principals<br>
    of science and engineering to improve the natural environment. Today we made a <br>
    water filter using cotton balls, sand, rocks, and a 2 liter soda bottle. We<br>
    compacted the cotton balls as the bottom layer, then poured sand on top, finally,<br>
    we put rocks to complete our filter. Our filter was able to make somewhat-clear water<br>
    which was an improvement from the sludge we started with.

    This week we started our Electrical Engineering unit. Electrical Engineering is a field of engineering<br>
    that works with electricity. Yesterday, we started messing around with the circuit feature on TinkerCad.<br>
    We used TinkerCad to simulate connecting circuits on a breadboard to turn on LEDs. Initially, I had trouble <br>
    connecting wires to turn on the LEDs but after a lot of trial and error I managed to hook up the wires <br>
    correctly. However, just connecting the wires wasn't enough because the LEDs kept exploding due to too <br>
    many Volts going into them. I had to adjust the resistors to lower the amount of energy and mess around <br>
    with the wires some more.
